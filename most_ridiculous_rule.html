   <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
   <p>When I was in the 4th grade my teacher made us ask to use tissues, so we didn't "interrupt" her class. In order to blow your nose, you had to ask the teacher if you could get up for a tissue.</p>
   <h3>Desperate Measures </h3>
   <p>Even when you sneezed you had to ask to get up for a tissue... If you got up to get a tissue without asking you got in trouble.</p>
